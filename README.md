# Git-Workshop
                                This project was created in order to assist with the learning of the following:

The basics of Git and Github
<br>The GitHub Workflow
<br>Command-line Git usage

I also learned how to make a pull request, comment on someone else's pull request, and compare & pull requests, . 

                                   I practiced a typical best practice developer workflow which consists of: 

1. fork
<br>2. branch
<br>3. stage
<br>4. commit
<br>5. merge

Lastly, I learned how to collectively use git and github together by configuring my local environment so that the correct Github account is assosciated with my commits! 

                                           Here are some of the command lines I was introduced to:

1. git config --global user.name "enter your username here"
<br>2. git config --global user.email "enter your email address here"
<br>3. git clone - to copy a repository to your computer
<br>4. git branch "name-of-branch" - create a branch
<br>5. git add - stage: saving your changes so they are ready to be added to your branch 
<br>6. git commit -m: a message explaining your commit also known as a comment
<br>7. git push - push: add the changes on your computer to your GitHub repository 
<br>8. git pull - bring changes from GitHub down to your local copy
<br>9. git checkout -b - checkout a new branch
<br>10. git status - tells us whether or not we have modified the specified file and that we have not added any changes to commit
<br>11. git add - gets your changes ready to be committed
<br>12. git checkout master - makes sure that your local master branch matches the master branch on github
<br>13 git stash - used to move changes between branches
